This WGU Capstone project is a practice of using machine learning to recommend users video games based on the selection of a video game they enjoy.

Please follow the steps outlined within the notebook 'GameRecommender'. I find it best to run each cell one at a time so that no user inputs are missed. Cells can be run by clicking on them, then hitting the 'play' button at the top of the window.
